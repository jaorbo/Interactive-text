			</p></h3>
			
				<p> 
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	I can’t sleep.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		It’s the strange bed.
				</p>

				<p>
				
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>		No. I like different places
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Are you cold?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>		No. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Do you want a drink?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I think I am cold.
				</p1></p>

				<p>	
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		That’s easy enough then. There’s extra blankets in the cupboard.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>		Is it late?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Two.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			Are you going to bed?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Do you want a hot drink?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			No thank you.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		I should go to bed then
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			Yes.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	It’s always odd in a new place. When you’ve been here a week you’ll look back at tonight and it won’t seem the same at all.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	I’ve been to a lot of places. I’ve stayed with friends at their homes. I don’t miss my parents if you think that.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Do you miss your dog?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I miss the cat I think.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Does it sleep on your bed?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	No because I chase it off. But it gets in if the door’s not properly shut. You think you’ve shut it but it hasn’t caught and she pushes it open in the night.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Come here a minute. You’re shivering. Are you hot?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			No, I’m all right.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		You’re over tired. Go to bed. I’m going to bed myself.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I went out.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		When? Just now?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			Just now.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		No wonder you’re cold. It’s hot in the daytime here but it is cold at night.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			The stars are brighter here than at home.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		It’s because there’s no street lights. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I couldn’t see much.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		I don’t expect you could. How did you get out?  I didn’t hear the door.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I just went out the window.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		I am not sure I like that.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			No it’s quite safe, there’s a roof and a tree.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	When people go to bed they should stay in bed. Do you climb out of the window at home?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I can’t at home because – No I don’t.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		I am responsible for you.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			Yes, I am sorry.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span> 	We’ll that’s enough adventure for one night. You’ll sleep now. Off you go. Look at you, you’re asleep on your feet.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			There was a reason.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		For going out?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I heard a noise.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		An owl?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			A shriek.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span> 			An owl then. There are all sorts of birds here, you might see a golden oriole. People come here especially to watch birds and we sometimes make tea or coffee or sell bottles of water because there’s no café and people don’t expect that and they get thirsty, You’ll see in the morning what a beautiful place it is. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			It was more like a person screaming.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		It’s like a person screaming when you hear an owl. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN	</span><p1>		It was a person screaming.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Poor girl, what a fright you must had imagining you heard somebody screaming. You should have come straight down here to me.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN	</span><p1>		I wanted to see.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		It was dark.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN	</span><p1>		Yes but I did see.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Now what did you imagine you saw in the dark?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN	</span><p1>		I saw my uncle.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Yes I expect you did. He likes a breath of air. He wasn’t screaming I hope?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			No.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	That’s all right then. Did you talk to him? I expect you were frightened he’d say what are you doing out of your bed so late.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I stayed in the tree.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		He didn’t see you?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			No.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	He’ll be surprised won’t he he’ll laugh when he hears you were up in the tree. He’ll be cross but he doesn’t mean it, he’ll think it’s a joke, it’s the sort of thing he did when he was a boy. So bed now. I’ll go up too. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			He was pushing someone. He was bundling someone into a shed.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		He must have been putting a big sack in the shed. He works too late.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			I am not sure if it was a woman. It could have been a young man.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Well I have to tell you, when you’ve been married as long as we have. There are things people get up to, it’s natural, it’s nothing bad, that’s just friends of his your uncle was having a little party with.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>		Was it a party?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Just a little party.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			Yes because there wasn’t just that one person. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		No there’d be a few of his friends.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			There was a lorry. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		Yes, I expect there was. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>			When I put my ear against the side of the lorry I heard crying inside.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>		How could you do that from up in the tree?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	I got down from the tree. I went to the lorry after I looked in the window of the shed.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	There might be things that are not your business when you’re a visitor in  someone else’s house
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Yes, I’d rather not have seen. I’m sorry. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Nobody saw you?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	They were thinking about themselves. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	I think it is lucky nobody saw you.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	If it’s a party, why was there so much blood?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	There isn’t any blood.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Yes.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Where?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	On the ground.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	In the dark? How would you see that in the dark?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	I slipped in it.
				</p1></p>

				<p><p1>
				<em> She holds her bare foot. </em>
				</p1></p>

				<p><p1>
				I mostly wiped it off.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	That’s where the dog got run over this afternoon.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Wouldn’t it have dried up?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Not if the ground was muddy.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	What sort of dog?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	A big dog, a big mongrel
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	That’s awful, you must be very sad, had you had him long?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	No, he was young, he ran out, he was never very obedient, a lorry was backing up.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	What was his name?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Flash.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	What colour was he?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Black with a bit of white.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Why were the children in the shed?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	What children?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Don’t you know about the children?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	How could you see there were children?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	There was a light on. That’s how I could see the blood inside the shed. I could see the faces and which one had the blood on.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	You’ve found out something secret. You know that don’t you?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Yes
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Something you shouldn’t know
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Yes I am sorry.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Something you must never talk about. Because if you do you could people’s lives in danger.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Why? Who from? From my uncle?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Of course not from your uncle.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	From you?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Of course not from me, are you mad? I’m going to tell you what’s going on. You’re uncle is helping these people. He’s helping them escape. He’s giving them shelter. Some of them were still in the lorry, that’s why they were crying. Your uncle’s going to take them all into the shed and then they’ll be all right. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	They had blood on their faces.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	That’s from before. That’s because they were attacked by the people your uncle’s saving them from.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	There was blood on the ground.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	One of them was injured very badly but your uncle bandaged him up.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	He’s helping them.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	That’s right.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	There wasn’t a dog. There wasn’t a party.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	No, I’m trusting you with the truth now. You must never talk about it or you’ll put your uncle’s life in danger and mine and even your own. You won’t even say anything to your parents.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Why did you have me stay if you’ve got this secret going on?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	The lorry should have come yesterday. It won’t happen again while you are here.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	It can now because I know. You didn’t have to stop for me. I could help uncle in the shed and look after them.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	No, he has to do it himself. But thank you for offering, that’s very kind, So after all that excitement do you think you could go back to bed?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Why was uncle hitting them?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Hitting who?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	He was hitting a man with a stick. I think the stick was metal. He hit one of the children.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	One of the people in the lorry was a traitor. He wasn’t really one of them, he was pretending, he was going to betray them, they found out and told your uncle. Then he attacked your uncle, he attacked the other people, your uncle had to fight him. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	That’s why there was so much blood.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	yes it had to be done to save the others. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	He hit one of the children. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	That would have been the child of the traitor. Or sometimes you get bad children who even betray their parents. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	What’s going to happen?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	They’ll go off in the lorry very early in the morning. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Where to?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Where they’re escaping to. You don’t want to have to keep any more secrets.  
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	He only hit the traitors. 
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	Of course. I am not surprised you can’t sleep, what an upsetting thing to see. But now you understand, it’s not so bad. You’re part of a big movement now to make things better. You can be proud of that. You can look at the stars and think here we are in our little bit of space, and I’m on the side of the people who are putting things right, and your soul will expand right into the sky.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Can’t I help?
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	You can help me clean up in the morning. Will you do that?
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">JOAN</span><p1>	Yes.
				</p1></p>

				<p>
				<span class="name">HARPER</span>	So you’d better get some sleep.
